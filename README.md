# Toucan

This is our app Toucan.

Link to access:
<https://shrouded-spire-27852.herokuapp.com/login>

Admin Account:
Username: Kevin DesLauriers
Password: bradiscool

A couple notes before running:
As admin you have access to both admin view (can add and delete courses and posts) and user view (cannot add and delete courses and posts).
When an account is created, it is by default a user (cannot add and delete courses and posts).

MongoDB might randomly crash making the app look like it has crashed, however that is simply due to the mongoDB server itself being unreliable.
As of submission, it seems that mongoDB atlas itself is down, but everything was working fine just a little earlier today.

Thanks,
The Toucan Team
